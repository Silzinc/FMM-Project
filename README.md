# Numerical physics class project
Many body simulation (FMM method)

***

## Project organisation

- [src](./src): production source code
- [design](./design): algorithm design scripts/notebooks
- [doc](./doc): documentation
- [test](./test): tests and data analysis

## Handling jupyter notebooks

Notebooks may be pushed in the `test` and `design` folders **without the output** which can be very heavy.
